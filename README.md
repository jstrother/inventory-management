# Inventory Management System

This is a simple program to keep track of pallets of product and product totals.  It uses React/Redux for the front end, Node and RethinkDB for the back end, and Socket.io to help them talk to each other in a useful real-time webapp.

## To Do List:
1. add in user sign-in and authentication with Passport
2. set up a way to customize pallet props in the react component (currently modelled on how Theo Chocolate keeps track of theirs) - I would like this to be useful to other organiztions/companies as well
3. other things as they come to mind
